Orange: Functions as mark. Both go below the consonants in word formations. 

Note on Orange tags: I have noticed in the Noto Chakma they have added extra glyphs for each consonant going below the main character. But after looking at text across books I have found only the “haa-chakma.below” and “u-chakma.below” to be in use, as marks. Others are not necessary, as this is not in practise presently in use plus old books where such combinations are found are influenced from Bengali primer books, people got confused with the concept of juktakhor in Bengali orthography.

Green (eMatra-chakma) : This is the only mark which should be positioned before the character. Or GPOS might be applicable

uuMatra-chakma: This mark is often represented by two straight lines in the existing typefaces, which looks borrowed from Myanmar’s typographic practices. For November Chakma I have decided to change it the shape closer to writing traditions found in various manuscripts as this also contributes to Chakma’s typographic identity.   

baa-chakma: This character is often related with “dhaa-chakma”, meaning the characters are just flipped. But upon looking at many many manuscripts I have come to this conclusion that they are both structurally different characters. I am adding a pdf file for this, baa is formed with one continuous stroke and dhaa with 2 strokes. This is again a case of influence from Myanmar’s typography, I have checked Myanmar has a similar looking character ba from which it could have been copied. Until I find anything more on this matter keeping it as it is.

five-chakma, nine-chakma, lhaa-chakma: For these characters I have followed the skeleton that I have found in my research materials. Noto Chakma has a slightly different structures for these characters. Until I find more on this going to keep it like this. Explained in the pdf
